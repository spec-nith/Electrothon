Obviously, we would love to have a lucky charm that ensures that our spaceship 🛸 of ideas doesn't stop till it reaches the moon 🌙 at Electrothon 5.0 . And what better way to do that than let you design our official Mascot!  We are tingling with excitement to flag off Mascot Designing Contest open for all.",
